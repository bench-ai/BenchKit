# *Bench-Kit*
Welcome to Bench-Kit! We are an End-To-End Free Machine Learning Model management platform.

We allow users to:
1) Train and deploy their models on the cloud with a fully managed infrastructure (no more cuda headaches 🙃)
2) Track their model runs
3) Graph Model Accuracy, and outputs

## Docs
- Check out the docs [here](https://docs.bench-ai.com/)

## Website

## How it works

Bench-Kit works in sync with the Bench AI site, and is completely free.
